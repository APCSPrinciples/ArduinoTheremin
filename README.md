# Build a Theremin like musical instrument
In this lab we will build a musical instrument that is controlled with a photoresitor. The photoresistor will respond to the shadow of our hand, so we won't need to touch it to make it respond. In this way, it is like a Theremin, a musical instrument that is played without touching it.
