# Build a Theremin like musical instrument
In this lab we will build a musical instrument that is controlled with a photoresitor. The photoresistor will respond to the shadow of our hand, so we won't need to actually touch it to make it respond. In this way, it is like a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin), a electronic musical instrument that is played without touching it.
### Step 1: Build the circuit
Our Theremin will use the following parts:
- 10KΩ resistor
- Photoresistor
- 3 Jumper wires   
Use the picture below to make sure you are using correct 10KΩ resistor.

The photoresistor has two leads of equal length. It is shown below:

Use the following circuit diagram to construct the circuit. The direction of the photoresistor and the 10KΩ resistor is unimportant.
